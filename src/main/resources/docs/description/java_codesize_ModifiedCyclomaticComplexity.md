Since: PMD 5.1.2

Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a method 
plus one for the method entry.  The decision points include 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels' calls.  
Generally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote
high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity. Modified complexity treats switch statements as a single
decision point.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {    // This has a Cyclomatic Complexity = 9
1   public void example()  {
2       if (a == b)  {
3           if (a1 == b1) {
                fiddle();
4           } else if a2 == b2) {
                fiddle();
            }  else {
                fiddle();
            }
5       } else if (c == d) {
6           while (c == d) {
                fiddle();
            }
7        } else if (e == f) {
8           for (int n = 0; n < h; n++) {
                fiddle();
            }
        } else{
9           switch (z) {
                case 1:
                    fiddle();
                    break;
                case 2:
                    fiddle();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    fiddle();
                    break;
                default:
                    fiddle();
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
